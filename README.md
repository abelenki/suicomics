### Introduction

SuiComics is a social web portal for creators and fans to self-publish their comic books, manga and graphic novels and monetise by means of virtual goods.

### How it works

On Suinova Comics, readers not only enjoy the books but also play the casual games. The games are associated with the book content.

Creators prepare both the book content and the virtual items to be used in the games. Some of these items are called virtual goods to be bought by the readers.

### How to use it

SuiComics is implemented on Google AppEngine. All you need is to create an application on Google AppEngine, and upload the lot to it.
